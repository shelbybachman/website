# Coding projects in R

- **Word prediction app**: As my capstone project for the Data Science Specialization on Coursera, I built a Shiny app that can predict the next words in a sentence, based on a series of inputted words.<br> [app](https://shelbybachman.shinyapps.io/Word-Prediction-App/) /  [github](https://github.com/shelbybachman/data-science-capstone)

- **Predictors of wine quality app**: I built a Shiny app to explore and model predictors of Portuguese wine quality, as part of Coursera's Developing Data Products course.<br>

- **Classification using accelerometer data**: <br>As my final project for Coursera's Practical Machine Learning Course, I used classification techniques to identify movement types based on accelerometer data.<br>

- **Tidy Tuesday visualizations**: <br>On (some) Tuesdays, I create data visualizations using the tidyverse.<br>

# Coding projects in python

- **Grocery list generator**: I wrote a program to create an organized grocery list and prettified image of the list based on user input.<br> [link](https://github.com/shelbybachman/grocery-list-generator) / [demo](https://youtu.be/T3yRK3ouw7g)

- **Mapping reward- and loss-related brain activity**: As part of Neuromatch Academy's Computational Neuroscience summer school, I analyzed fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project to examine how monetary reward and loss modulated brain activity.<br> [slides](https://github.com/shelbybachman/neuromatch-academy-2021/blob/d7920c979e919f2be8f1e6e192ed78b715b10781/nma-project-slides.pdf) / [notebook](https://github.com/shelbybachman/neuromatch-academy-2021/blob/d42f91d484d0c6091ac733740b3f8eec1035f35b/NMA_project.ipynb)

- **Analysis of mobile app ratings**: I used data from the Google Play and Apple App Stores to perform some basic analyses exploring which apps attract the most users.<br>

- **Analysis of prison escapes by helicopter**: Using data from Wikipedia, I did some basic exploration of worldwide prison escapes that occurred by helicopter.<br>

# Teaching

- **Introductory R & MATLAB tutorial**: In 2019, I led a tutorial for research assistants in the Emotion & Cognition Lab focused on the basics of scientific programming in R and MATLAB and creating experiments in Psychtoolbox.<br> [link](https://shelbybachman.github.io/RA-tutorial-2019/) / [github](https://github.com/shelbybachman/RA-tutorial-2019)

- **Intermediate R tutorial**: In 2020, led a tutorial for research assistants in the Emotion & Cognition Lab covering the tidyverse, reproducible reporting with R markdown, and basic statistics<br> [link](https://shelbybachman.github.io/RA-tutorial-2020/) [github](https://github.com/shelbybachman/RA-tutorial-2020)

# Academic projects

- **Daily heart rate variability biofeedback training decreases locus coeruleus MRI contrast in younger adults**. The brain's arousal hub region, the locus coeruleus (LC), is bidirectionally connected to the autonomic nervous system, but less in known about factors that affect the LC over time. We tested how a 5-week intervention involving daily heart rate variability biofeedback training affected LC MRI contrast, an in vivo measure of LC structure. Using mixed-effects regression and correlation analyses, we found that LC contrast decreased among participants who performed daily biofeedback, and decreases in LC contrast were related to how much participants increased their heart rate oscillations during training, as well as decreases in sympathetic nervous system signaling.<br>

- **Locus coeruleus MRI contrast is associated with cortical thickness in older adults.** Based on growing evidence that the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) is important for later-life outcomes, we examined relationships between LC MRI contrast, a measure of LC structure, and cortical thickness in younger and older adults from the Berlin Aging Study-II, using multiple linear regression. We found that higher LC contrast was associated with greater cortical thickness in older adults, especially in brain regions that belong to the brain's frontoparietal attention network.<br>
