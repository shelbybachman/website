# Coding projects in R

- **Word prediction app**: As a final project for a data science capstone course, I built a Shiny app that can predict the next words in a sentence<br> [app](https://shelbybachman.shinyapps.io/Word-Prediction-App/) [github](https://github.com/shelbybachman/data-science-capstone)

- **Predictors of wine quality app**: I built a Shiny app to explore and model predictors of vinho verde wine quality, for a course on Developing Data Products<br>

- **Classification using accelerometer data**: <br>In a final project for a Practical Machine Learning Course, I used classification techniques to identify movement types based on accelerometer data<br>

- **Tidy Tuesday visualizations**: <br>On (some) Tuesdays, I create data visualizations with `ggplot2`<br>

# Coding projects in python

- **Grocery list generator**: I wrote a program to create an organized grocery list and prettified image of the list based on user input<br> [link](https://github.com/shelbybachman/grocery-list-generator) [demo](https://youtu.be/T3yRK3ouw7g)

- **Mapping reward- and loss-related brain activity**: As part of Neuromatch Academy's Computational Neuroscience summer school, I analyzed fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project to examine how monetary reward and loss modulated brain activity<br> [slides](https://github.com/shelbybachman/neuromatch-academy-2021/blob/d7920c979e919f2be8f1e6e192ed78b715b10781/nma-project-slides.pdf) [notebook](https://github.com/shelbybachman/neuromatch-academy-2021/blob/d42f91d484d0c6091ac733740b3f8eec1035f35b/NMA_project.ipynb)

# Teaching

- **Introductory R & MATLAB tutorial**: I led a tutorial for research assistants focused on introductory R, introductory matlab, and creating behavioral experiments in MATLAB<br> [link](https://shelbybachman.github.io/RA-tutorial-2019/)

- **Intermediate R tutorial**: I led another tutorial covering the tidyverse, R markdown, and basic statistics<br> [link](https://shelbybachman.github.io/RA-tutorial-2020/) [github](https://shelbybachman.github.io/RA-tutorial-2019/)
