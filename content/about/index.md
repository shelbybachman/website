Hi! I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Southern California, working under the supervision of Dr. Mara Mather in the [Emotion & Cognition Lab](https://gero.usc.edu/labs/matherlab/). My research focuses on how emotion, stress and physiological arousal affect what we remember and pay attention to, and how these processes change across the lifespan. I use behavioral, psychophysiological and neuroimaging methods in my research. You can find a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kB3eowgAAAAJ&hl=en).
