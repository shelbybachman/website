Hi! I'm a Research Scientist at VivoSense, where I use data from wearable devices to develop digital measures that can be deployed in clinical trials. Prior to working at VivoSense, I did a PhD in the [Emotion & Cognition Lab](https://gero.usc.edu/labs/matherlab/) at the University of Southern California, where I studied how stress and physiological arousal affect what we remember and pay attention to, and how these processes change across the lifespan. Prior to that, I studied neuroscience at Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin and the University of Southern California. You can find a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kB3eowgAAAAJ&hl=en).
